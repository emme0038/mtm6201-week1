    <p>My name is Sean Emmerson. I'm from Ottawa, I'm 19 years old and a student at Algonquin College. In my spare
        time, I enjoy taking pictures and
        making music. In fact, I recently graduated from the <abbr title="Music Industry Arts">MIA</abbr> program
        here at
        Algonquin with Dean's Honours. My end goal after this program is to secure a job in graphic or web
        design, since I'm fond of both.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn a lot from this course, and I hope to incorporate web development and elements of design
        thinking into my everyday hobbies. I'm excited to implement new things I learn into my art and to solve
        problems in the real and virtual world.</p>
